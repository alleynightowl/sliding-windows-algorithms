# sliding-windows-algorithms


Sliding window algorithm is used to perform required operation on specific window size of given large buffer or array. Window starts from the 1st element and keeps shifting right by one element. The objective is to find the minimum k numbers present in each window. This is commonly know as Sliding window problem or algorithm.

The Sliding Window algorithm is one way programmers can move towards simplicity in their code. This algorithm is exactly as it sounds; a window is formed over some part of data, and this window can slide over the data to capture different portions of it
